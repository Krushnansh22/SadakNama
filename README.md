## üõ£Ô∏è SadakNama: Public Accountability Portal for Road Infrastructure

### The Core Idea: Transparency in Road Projects

**SadakNama** (meaning *"Road Scroll"* or *"Road Record"*) is an initiative to create a **Public Accountability Portal** dedicated to road infrastructure projects.  
Our goal is to fight opacity and corruption by making every piece of information about road construction and maintenance **readily accessible to the public**.

We aim to create a single, easy-to-use platform that links a road's quality directly to the entities responsible for it.

### üéØ Our Mission: Public Accountability

The primary goal is to foster transparency and hold all involved parties accountable:

- **Contractors** ‚Äì The firms who build and maintain the roads.  
- **Approving Officials** ‚Äì The government bureaucrats/officials who sanction the projects.  
- **Ministers** ‚Äì The political leadership involved in the project's approval.  
- **Project Details** ‚Äì Total cost, timelines, and status.

By making this data transparent, citizens can monitor project quality, report issues, and demand better performance from their government and contracted firms.
